ABOUT

I know the whole glass effect is old, tried, tired and tested, I just wanted to
make a theme out of it. I am not a big fan of generic mac ports, so I figured
I'd try something a little different.

This theme came about after a conversation between myself and everdark
concerning the lack of killer n?x themes. I decided it was time to make a bit
more effort. Blue Steel, bluehEart & any darkalloy (Brass, Anomaly etc...)
theme still hold up today, but there seems to be a lack of new themes that can
compete on this level.

I am in NO WAY suggesting that this theme is great, I am also NOT saying this
is the best theme made since 2001. I'm just hoping that you feel that this is
a step in the right direction.

CREDITS

I would like to thank all the friends that I have made at deviantart.com and
all the great skin designers that reside there. You guys have inspired me
beyond my own expectations. By viewing the works of others I have learned a
great deal.

Thanks!

Extra special thanks go to Hippy (http://hippy.deviantart.com) for the glass
tutorial. It may have been for paint shop, but it gave me pointers and taught
me more about gimp. Also to Azundris for pointing out my error in the check /
radio buttons.

Extra configuration files & info in the CONFIG dir.
