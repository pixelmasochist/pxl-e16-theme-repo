Enlightenment Theme standard:

if you wish to make themes as of 0.16 of E you MUSt conforom to this standard.
there hasnt been a de-facto CLEAN standard forthcoming from the theme makers,
so I have imposed one. It goes as follows:

your theme must contain the base cfg files as in shown in this tarball:
borders.cfg
buttons.cfg
colormodifiers.cfg
cursors.cfg
desktops.cfg
imageclasses.cfg
init.cfg
menustyles.cfg
slideouts.cfg
sound.cfg
tooltips.cfg
windowmatches.cfg

you must include the directories and cfg files and their paths:

backgrounds/images
backgrounds/backgrounds.cfg
borders/common/images
borders/[BORDER_NAME]/images
borders/[BORDER_NAME]/border.cfg
borders/borders.cfg
borders/common/borders.cfg
buttons/images
buttons/buttons.cfg
common/images
coords/images
coords/coords.cfg
cursors/bw_images
cursors/images
cursors/cursors.cfg
dialogs/images
dialogs/dialogs.cfg
dock/images
dock/dock.cfg
dragbar/images
dragbar/dragbar.cfg
focuslist/images
focuslist/focuslist.cfg
iconbox/images
iconbox/iconbox.cfg
init/images
init/init.cfg
menustyles/images
menustyles/menustyles.cfg
pager/images
pager/pager.cfg
slideouts/images
slideouts/slideouts.cfg
sound/samples
sound/sound.cfg
tooltips/images
tooltips/tooltips.cfg
ttfonts/

if your theme doesnt have any data for that element of a theme keep the base
cfg file(s) that #includes others, and just have the #included files be empty
(see buttons.cfg for an example)

button should ONLY be used for decoration - ie making round corners like a
macos screen or such. they shouls also contain apporpriate actionclasses
from one of the actionclasses below. parts of a window border shoudl only use
ythe list of actionclasses below (note in future this list may be expanded.
using actionclasses not in this list for parts of window borders is
considered ``illegal''. if you REALLY REALLy need to create a custom
imageclass that is in the border.cfg or buttons.cfg file just before the
border or button section and sname it CUSTOM_THEME_something - CUSTOM_THEME
namespace will remain reserved for themes. if you thik your actionclass is
a good generic one to have please mail the e-devel mailing list suggesting it
and it may be adopted for the next revision).

ACTION_BUTTON_DRAG
ACTION_GOTO_DESK_NEXT
ACTION_GOTO_DESK_PREV
ACTION_MOVE
ACTION_SHADE
ACTION_RESIZE
ACTION_RESIZE_H
ACTION_RESIZE_V
ACTION_KILL
ACTION_MAXH
ACTION_MAXW
ACTION_MAX
ACTION_SEND_NEXT
ACTION_SEND_PREV
ACTION_SNAPSHOT
ACTION_ONLY_SHADE
ACTION_MENU
ACTION_ICONIFY
ACTION_RAISE
ACTION_LOWER
ACTION_STICK

these actions do pretty much what they say they do. use them appropriately.
in future these actions will be uses configurable so do ont always expect
them to to EXACTLY what they say - users may re-configure them.

please keep all data local to the object its for (ie images used for pagers
put int he pagers/images directory and declate the imageclasses etc. in
pagers.cfg) - common/ is inteded for data that is shared.
