Here's the complete BSD-able pixelmasochist e16 theme collection.

When I say BSD-able, it's all BSD Clause 3 License. I have made other themes,
but due to their nature I can not release them under this license. R-9X was a
port, so to throw some one else's copyright into the wind is a tad
disrespectful.

Anyway...

I hope you enjoy using these themes as much as I have and still do enjoy making
them.

Cheers :)
