Really TODO

XMMS Control panel buttons
Images for all those slideouts
find out what the iconbox configuration dialog's name is
remove the cache purge from the button bar
Unlamify the SHAPED border
fix side border bits
Add a button that launches top
Make Eterm themes for Vim, BitchX (irssi?), Rexima, ncftp and Mutt.
Try and get all the right mouse slideouts to be *real* kde apps.

Possibilities/wishlist

Make a gimp specific border style
Add some kind of game launcher
Make this whole toolbar/slideout thing easier to configure
Take rasterman out for a beer!
